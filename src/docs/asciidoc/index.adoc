== Agenda

- Quick overview of the build cache
- Build cache concepts
- Demos
- Q&A

== Build cache

=== What is it?

* Released with Gradle 3.5
* Stable for Java in 4.0
* Uniquely identifies outputs of tasks by inputs
** Keeps them in a local cache
** Shares them with a remote cache (provided by Gradle Enterprise)

=== How does it help?

* Save time by reusing outputs from other builds
** On your machine
** On CI

== Build Cache Concepts

=== Build cache key
* Build cache key is calculated using 
** Task implementation (including Gradle version)
** Task action implementations
** Names of the output properties
** Names and values of task inputs
* **NOTE**: Task name is not an input

=== Relationship with incremental builds
* Reliable incremental builds are a prerequisite for cacheability
* Be sure that your tasks are up-to-date when expected before trying to make them cacheable
* Cacheable tasks require additional information for path sensitivity 

=== Stable inputs
* Inputs need to be _stable_ for reliable cache hits
* Typical sources of volatility: 
** Files or input properties that contain timestamps
** Files or input properties that contains absolute file paths
** Files or input properties influenced by non-determinstic ordering 

=== Normalization
* `@Classpath` -- treats files as a Java classpath
* `@CompileClasspath` -- Extracts ABI from classes
* Configurable runtime normalization:
** Coarse method for removing inputs from up-to-date checks

== Demos

=== Incremental build
=== Caching same workspace
=== Missing task inputs
=== Caching different workspace
