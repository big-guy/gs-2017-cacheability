== Agenda

- Quick overview of the build cache
- Build cache concepts
- Demos
- Q&A

== Build cache

=== What is it?

* Released with Gradle 3.5
* Stable for Java in 4.0
* Uniquely identifies outputs of tasks by inputs
** Keeps them in a local cache
** Shares them with a remote cache (provided by https://gradle.com/build-cache[Gradle Enterprise])

=== How does it help?

* Save time by reusing outputs from other builds
** On your machine
** On CI
* Our build saves https://blog.gradle.org/introducing-gradle-build-cache[25% on average], but YMMV.

== Build Cache Concepts

=== Build cache key
* Build cache key is calculated using 
** Task implementation (including Gradle version)
** Task action implementations
** Names of the output properties
** Names and values of task inputs
* **NOTE**: Task name is not an input

=== Relationship with incremental builds
* First, get reliable incremental builds
* Next, get cacheable builds 
* Cacheable tasks require additional information for path sensitivity 

=== Repeatable outputs

* Same inputs should produce same outputs
* May be byte-for-byte equivalent
* May be semantically equivalent (with normalization)

=== Stable inputs
* Inputs need to be _stable_ for reliable cache hits
* Typical sources of volatility: 
** Files or input properties that contain timestamps
** Files or input properties that contains absolute file paths
** Files or input properties influenced by non-determinstic ordering 

=== Normalization
* `@InputFiles` -- no normalization
* `@CompileClasspath` -- Extracts ABI from classes
* `@Classpath` -- treats files as a runtime Java classpath
* Configurable runtime normalization:
** Coarse method for removing inputs from up-to-date checks

== Demos

=== Incremental build
=== Caching same workspace
=== Missing task inputs
=== Caching different workspace
